NICKELBACK - IF TODAY WAS YOUR LAST DAY LYRICS,"My best friend gave me the best advice He said each days a gift and not a given right Leave no stone unturned, leave your fears behind And try to take the path less traveled by That first step you take is the longest stride  If today was your last day and tomorrow was too late Could you say goodbye to yesterday? Would you live each moment like your last Leave old pictures in the past? Donate every dime you had, if today was your last day? What if, what if, if today was your last day?  Against the grain should be a way of life Whats worth the price is always worth the fight Every second counts cause theres no second try So live like youre never living twice Dont take the free ride in your own life  If today was your last day and tomorrow was too late Could you say goodbye to yesterday? Would you live each moment like your last? Leave old pictures in the past? Donate every dime you had?  And would you call those friends you never see? Reminisce old memories? Would you forgive your enemies? And would you find that one youre dreaming of? Swear up and down to God above That youd finally fall in love if today was your last day?  If today was your last day Would you make your mark by mending a broken heart? You know its never too late to shoot for the stars Regardless of who you are  So do whatever it takes Cause you cant rewind a moment in this life Let nothing stand in your way Cause the hands of time are never on your side  If today was your last day and tomorrow was too late Could you say goodbye to yesterday? Would you live each moment like your last? Leave old pictures in the past? Donate every dime you had?  And would you call those friends you never see? Reminisce old memories? Would you forgive your enemies? And would you find that one youre dreaming of Swear up and down to God above That youd finally fall in love if today was your last day?",2009

LINKIN PARK - IN THE END LYRICS,"It starts with One thing I dont know why It doesnt even matter how hard you try Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme To explain in due time  All I know Time is a valuable thing Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings Watch it count down to the end of the day The clock ticks life away  Its so unreal Didnt look out below Watch the time go right out the window Trying to hold on, but didnt even know Or wasted it all just to watch you go  I kept everything inside And even though I tried, it all fell apart What it meant to me will eventually be A memory of a time when  I tried so hard and got so far But in the end it doesnt even matter I had to fall to lose it all But in the end it doesnt even matter  One thing, I dont know why It doesnt even matter how hard you try Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme To remind myself how  I tried so hard In spite of the way you were mocking me Acting like I was part of your property Remembering all the times you fought with me Im surprised  It got so far Things arent the way they were before You wouldnt even recognize me anymore Not that you knew me back then But it all comes back to me in the end  You kept everything inside And even though I tried, it all fell apart What it meant to me will eventually be A memory of a time when  I tried so hard and got so far But in the end it doesnt even matter I had to fall to lose it all But in the end it doesnt even matter  Ive put my trust in you Pushed as far as I can go And for all this Theres only one thing you should know  Ive put my trust in you Pushed as far as I can go And for all this Theres only one thing you should know  I tried so hard and got so far But in the end it doesnt even matter I had to fall to lose it all But in the end it doesnt even matter",2002

T.I. - LIVE YOUR LIFE LYRICS,"(Rihanna): Youre gonna be a shining star, fancy clothes, fancy car-ars. And then youll see, youre gonna go far. Cause everyone knows, who you are-are. So live your life, ay ay ay. intead of chasing that paper. Just live your life (Oh!), ay ay ay. Aint got no time for no haters. Just live your life (Oh!), ay ay ay. No telling where itll take you.

Just living my life (ay), my life (oh), my life (ay), my life (oh) Just living my life (ay), my life (oh), my life (ay), my life (oh) (T.I.): Nevermind what haters say, ignore them til they fade away. Amazing they ungrateful after all the games I gave away. Safe to say I payed the way, for you cats to get paid today. You still be wasting days away, nah had I never saved the day. Consider them my protégé, homage I think they should pay. Instead of being gracious, they violated in a major way.I never been a hater still I love them, yeah I graze the way. Some say they so yay and no they couldnt even work on Labor day. It aint that they black or white, their hands of area in shades of grey. Im West side anyway, even if I left the day it fades away. Some move away to make a way not move away cause they afraid. Ill go back to the hood and all you ever did was hate away. I pray for patience but they make me want to face away.  Like I once made them scream, now I could make them plead their case away. Been thuggin all my life, cant say I dont deserve to take a break. If you ever see me catch a case, and watch my future fade away. (Rihanna): Youre gonna be a shining star, fancy clothes, fancy car-ars. And then youll see, youre gonna go far.

(T.I.): Im the opposite of moderate, immaculately polished with the spirit of a hustler and the swagger of a college kid. Allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics. Articulate but still would grab a nigga by the collar quick. Whoever had problems, they reckoncile they just holla tip. If that dont work and just fails, then turn around and follow tip. I got love for the game but ay Im not in love with all of it. I do without the fame and the rappers nowadays are comedy. The hootin and the hollerin, back and forth with the arguing. Where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in.  Seems as though you lost sight of whats important when depositing your checks into your bank account, and youre about poverted.  Your values is a disarrayed, prioritized are horribly. Unhappy with the riches cause you piss poor morraly. Ignoring all prior advice and fore warning. And we might be full of ourselves all of a sudden arent we? (Rihanna): Youre gonna be a shining star, fancy clothes, fancy car-ars. And then youll see, youre gonna go far. Cause everyone knows, who you are-are. So live your life, ay ay ay. instead of chasing that paper. Just live your life (Oh!), ay ay ay. Aint got no time for no haters Just live your life (Oh!), ay ay ay. No telling where itll take you.

ALAN JACKSON - WHERE WERE YOU (WHEN THE WORLD STOPPED TURNING) LYRICS,"Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day? Were you in the yard with your wife and children Or working on some stage in L.A.? Did you stand there in shock at the sight of that black smoke Risin against that blue sky? Did you shout out in anger, in fear for your neighbor Or did you just sit down and cry?  Did you weep for the children who lost their dear loved ones And pray for the ones who dont know? Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble And sob for the ones left below? Did you burst out with pride for the red, white and blue And the heroes who died just doin what they do? Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer And look at yourself and what really matters?  Im just a singer of simple songs Im not a real political man I watch CNN but Im not sure I can tell You the difference in Iraq and Iran But I know Jesus and I talk to God And I remember this from when I was young Faith, hope and love are some good things He gave us And the greatest is love  Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day? Were you teaching a class full of innocent children Or driving down some cold interstate? Did you feel guilty cause youre a survivor In a crowded room did you feel alone? Did you call up your mother and tell her you loved her? Did you dust off that Bible at home?  Did you open your eyes, hope it never happened Close your eyes and not go to sleep? Did you notice the sunset the first time in ages Or speak to some stranger on the street? Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow Or go out and buy you a gun? Did you turn off that violent old movie youre watchin And turn on I Love Lucy reruns?  Did you go to a church and hold hands with some strangers Did you stand in line and give your own blood? Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family Thank God you had somebody to love?  And the greatest is love. And the greatest is love.  Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day?",2002

Did you finally get the chance To dance along the light of day And head back to the Milky Way? And tell me, did Venus blow your mind?  Was it everything you wanted to find? And then you missed me While you were looking for yourself out there  Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken Your best friend always sticking up for you  Even when I know youre wrong? Can you imagine no first dance, freeze-dried romance Five-hour phone conversation The best soy latte that you ever had, and me?  But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet? Did you finally get the chance To dance along the light of day  And head back toward the Milky Way? But tell me, did you sail across the sun? Did you make it to the Milky Way To see the lights all faded And that heaven is overrated? And tell me, did you fall for a shooting star? One without a permanent scar And then you missed me While you were looking for yourself? And did you finally get the chance To dance along the light of day? And did you fall for a shooting star? Fall for a shooting star? And now youre lonely looking for yourself out there",2001

She woke up with hope But she only found tears And I can be so insincere Makin her promises never for real  As long as she stands there waiting Wearing the holes in the soles of her shoes How many days disappear when you look in the mirror So how do ya choose?  Your clothes never wear as well the next day And your hair never falls in quite the same way But you never seem to run out of things to say  This is the story of a girl Who cried a river and drowned the whole world And while she looked so sad in photographs I absolutely love her when she smiles  And how many lovers would stay Just to put up with this shit day after day How did we wind up this way Watchin our mouths for the words that we say  As long as we stand here waiting Wearing the clothes of the souls that we choose How do we get there today? When youre walking to far for the price of your shoes  Your clothes never wear as well the next day And your hair never falls in quite the same way But you never seem to run out of things to say  This is the story of a girl Who cried a river and drowned the whole world And while she looks so sad and lonely there I absolutely love her when she smiles  Well, your clothes never wear as well the next day And your hair never falls in quite the same way But you never seem to run out of things to say  This is the story of a girl Who cried a river and drowned the whole world And while she looked so sad in photographs I absolutely love her  This is the story of a girl A pretty face she hid from the world And while she looks so sad and lonely there I absolutely love her  This is the story of a girl Who cried a river and drowned the whole world And while she looked so sad in photographs I absolutely love her when she smiles When she smiles",2000

THE FRAY - HOW TO SAVE A LIFE LYRICS,"Step one, you say, We need to talk. He walks, you say, Sit down. Its just a talk. He smiles politely back at you You stare politely right on through Some sort of window to your right As he goes left and you stay right Between the lines of fear and blame You begin to wonder why you came  Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend Somewhere along in the bitterness And I would have stayed up with you all night Had I known how to save a life  Let him know that you know best Cause after all you do know best Try to slip past his defense Without granting innocence Lay down a list of what is wrong The things youve told him all along Pray to God, he hears you And I pray to God, he hears you  And where did I go wrong? I lost a friend Somewhere along in the bitterness And I would have stayed up with you all night Had I known how to save a life  As he begins to raise his voice You lower yours and grant him one last choice Drive until you lose the road Or break with the ones youve followed He will do one of two things He will admit to everything Or hell say hes just not the same And youll begin to wonder why you came  Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend Somewhere along in the bitterness And I would have stayed up with you all night Had I known how to save a life  Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend Somewhere along in the bitterness And I would have stayed up with you all night Had I known how to save a life  How to save a life  How to save a life  Where did I go wrong?
