And flowers swaying in the breeze Look up to the branches of the trees And  sing as  birds take wing All this is true cause I love you.",1965

IRISH ROVERS - THE UNICORN LYRICS,"Irish Rovers The Unicorn The Unicorn A long time ago, when the earth was green,  There were more kinds of animals than youve ever seen.  Theyd run around free while the earth was being born.  And the loveliest of them all was the unicorn.   There were green alligators and long-necked geese.  Some humpy-backed camels and some chimpanzees.  Some cats and rats and elephants, as sure as youre born.  And the loveliest of them all was the unicorn.   Now, God saw some sinning, and it gave him pain.  So he said, Stand back, Im going to make it rain.  He said, Hey, Brother Noah, Ill tell you what to do:  Build me a floating zoo.   And take some of them green alligators and long-necked geese.  Some humpy-backed camels and some chimpanzees.  Some cats and rats and elephants, as sure as youre born.  And dont you forget my unicorn.   Old Noah was there to answer the call.  He finished up making the Ark just as the rain started falling.  He marched in the animals two by two,  And he called out as they went through,   Hey Lord, I got your green alligators and long-necked geese,  Some humpy-backed camels and some chimpanzees.  Some cats and rats and elephants, but Lord, Im so forlorn.  I just cant see no unicorn.   Then Noah looked out through the driving rain.  Them unicorns were hiding, playing silly games.  Kicking and splashing while the rain was pourin.  Oh them silly unicorn!   There were green alligators and long-necked geese,  Some humpy-backed camels and some chimpanzees.  Noah cried, Close the door, cause the rain is pourin  And we just cant wait for no unicorn.   The Ark started moving, it drifted with the tide.  The unicorns looked up from the rocks, and they cried.  And the waters came down and sort of floated them away.  And thats why youve never seen a unicorn, to this very day.   Youll see green alligators and long-necked geese,  Some humpy-backed camels and some chimpanzees.  Some cats and rats and elephant, but sure as youre born,  Youre never gonna see no unicorn.",1968

So I said, Goodbye, Kansas, Mo. And hello, Washington Square!  Near Tennessee, I met a guy who played 12-string guitar. He also had a mighty voice, not to mention a car. Each time he hit those bluegrass chords, you sure smelled mountain air,  I said, Dont waste it on the wind. Cmon to Washington Square.  In New Orleans, we saw a gal a-walkin with no shoes,  An from her throat there comes a growl, she sure was singin the blues. She sang for all humanity, this gal with raven hair. I said, Its for the world to hear, Cmon to Washington Square.  We cannonballed into New York on good old US 1,  Till up ahead we saw the arch, a-gleamin bright in the sun. As far as all the eye could see, ten thousand folks was there,  And singin in sweet harmony right in Washington Square.  Say hows about a freedom song, or the ole Rock Island Line!  Or hows about the dust-bowl crop, or men who work in a mine? The songs and legends of our land is gold we all can share,  So come and join us folks who stand and sing in Washington Square.",1963

BOB DYLAN - LIKE A ROLLING STONE LYRICS,"Once upon a time you dressed so fine Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didnt you? People call, say, Beware doll youre bound to fall You thought they were all kiddin you  You used to laugh about everybody that was hangin out Now you dont talk so loud Now you dont seem so proud About having to be scrounging your next meal  How does it feel? How does it feel? To be without a home Like a complete unknown Like a rolling stone  Youve gone to the finest school, all right Miss Lonely But you know you only used to get juiced in it Nobodys ever taught you how to live out on the street And now youre gonna have to get used to it  You said youd never compromise with the mystery tramp But now you realize, hes not selling any alibis As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes And say, Do you want to make a deal?  How does it feel? How does it feel? To be on your own With no direction home A complete unknown Like a rolling stone  You never turned around to see the frowns On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you Never understood that it aint no good You shouldnt let other people get your kicks for you  You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat Aint it hard when you discover that he really wasnt where its at? After he took from you everything he could steal  How does it feel? How does it feel? To be on your own With no direction home Like a complete unknown Like a rolling stone  Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people Theyre all drinkin, thinkin that they got it made Exchanging all precious gifts But you better take your diamond ring, you better pawn it babe  You used to be so amused at Napoleon in rags And the language that he used, go to him now he calls you You cant refuse, when you got nothing, you got nothing to lose Youre invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal  How does it feel? How does it feel? To be on your own With no direction home Like a complete unknown Like a rolling stone",1965
