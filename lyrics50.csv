THE DOMINOES - THESE FOOLISH THINGS LYRICS,"Oh! Will you never let me be? Oh! Will you never set me free? The ties that bound us Are still around us Theres no escape that I can see And still those little things remain That bring me happiness or pain  A cigarette that bears a lipsticks traces An airline ticket to romantic places And still my heart has wings These foolish things remind me of you A tinkling piano in the next apartment Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant A fair grounds painted swings These foolish things remind me of you You came you saw you conquerd me When you did that to me I knew somehow this had to be The winds of March that make my heart a dancer A telephone that rings but whos to answer? Oh, how the ghost of you clings! These foolish things remind me of you  First daffodils and long excited cables And candle lights on little corner tables And still my heart has wings These foolish things remind me of you The park at evening when the bell has sounded The Ile de France with all the gulls around it The beauty that is Springs These foolish things remind me of you How strange how sweet to find you still These things are dear to me They seem to bring you near to me The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations Oh, how the ghost of you clings! These foolish things remind me of you  Gardenia perfume lingring on a pillow Wild strawbries only seven francs a kilo And still my heart has wings These foolish things remind me of you The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses The waiters whistling as the last bar closes The song that Crosby sings These foolish things remind me of you How strange how sweet to find you still  These things are dear to me They seem to bring you near to me The scent of smouldring leaves, the wail of steamers Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers Oh, how the ghost of you clings! These foolish things remind me of you",1953

WINK MARTINDALE - DECK OF CARDS LYRICS,"NARRATIVE: During the North African campaign, a bunch of soldier boys had been on a long hike and they arrived in a little town called Casino. The next morning being Sunday, several of the boys went to Church. A sergeant commanded the boys in Church and after the Chaplain had read the prayer, the text was taken up next. Those of the boys who had a prayer book took them out, but this one boy had only a deck of cards, and so he spread them out. The Sergeant saw the cards and said, Soldier, put away those cards. After the services was over, the soldier was taken prisoner and brought before the Provost Marshall.  The Marshall said, Sergeant, why have you brought this man here? For playing cards in church, Sir. And what have you to say for yourself, son? Much, Sir, replied the soldier. The Marshall said, I hope so, for if not I shall punish you more than any man was ever punished. The soldier said, Sir, I have been on the march for about six days. I have neither a Bible nor a prayer book, but I hope to satisfy you, Sir, with the purity of my intentions. And with that, the boy started his story:  You see Sir, when I look at the Ace, it reminds me that there is but one God. And the Deuce reminds me that the Bible is divided into two parts, the Old and the New Testaments. When I see the Trey, I think of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. And when I see the Four, I think of the four Evangelists who preached the Gospel; there was Matthew,   Mark, Luke and John. And when I see the Five, it reminds me of the five wise virgins who trimmed their lamps; there were ten of them: five were wise and were saved, five were foolish and were shut out. When I see the Six, it reminds me that in six days, God made this great heaven and earth. When I see the Seven, it reminds me that on the seventh day, God rested from His great work. And when I see the Eight, I think of the eight righteous persons God saved when He destroyed this earth; there was Noah, his wife, their sons and their wives. And when I see the Nine, I think of the lepers our Savior cleansed, and nine out of the ten didnt even thank Him. When I see the Ten, I think of the Ten Commandments God handed down to Moses on a table of stone. When I see the King, it reminds me that there is but one King of Heaven, God Almighty. And when I see the Queen, I think of the Blessed Virgin Mary, who is Queen of Heaven. And the Jack or Knave is the Devil. When I count the number of spots on a deck of cards, I find 365, the number of days in a year. There are 52 cards, the number of weeks in a year. There are 4 suits, the number of weeks in a month. There are 12 picture cards, the number of months in a year. There are 13 tricks, the number of weeks in a quarter. So you see, Sir, my pack of cards serves me as a Bible, an Almanac and a Prayer Book.  And friends, the story is true. I know, I was that soldier.",1959

RAINBOWS - MARY LEE LYRICS,"Twas all on a cold winters night When the winds blew across the wild moor, That Mary came wandring along with her child, Till she came to her own fathers door. O why did I leave this dear spot, Where once I was happy and free? And now doomed to roam without friends or a home, And none to take pity on me? O father, dear father, she cried, Do come downstairs and open the door! For the child in my arms will perish and die From the winds that blow cross the wild moor. But the old man was deaf to her cries, Not a sound of her voice did he hear, But the watchdog did howl and tAe village bell tolled And the winds blew across the wild moor. O how must the old man have felt When he came to the door the next morn And found Mary dead, but the child was alive, Closely clasped in its dead mothers arms. With anguish he tore his gray hair, While the tears down his cheeks they did roll Saying, There Mary died, once the gay village bride, From the winds that blew cross the wild moor. The old man with grief pined away, And the child to its mother went soon; Theres no one, they say, has lived there to this day, And the cottage to ruin has gone. The villagers point out the spot, Where the willows droop over the door, Saying, There Mary died, once the gay village bride, From the winds that blew cross the wild moor.",1954
