MARKY MARK AND THE FUNKY BUNCH - WILDSIDE LYRICS,"Marky Mark And The Funky Bunch Wildside Wildside Ah yeah huh American the beautiful  huh yeah let me introduce yall to the wildside  Annie was a high school cheerleader  Pom poms and bobby socks and no girl was sweeter  Come prom time everybody was on the line  All the fellas singing nickel and dime  Tales about love and lust and trust  But Annie took it in all in stride  Cause deep inside annie had aspirations  Wanted to be a chemical engineer  making 50 to 55 thousand a year  Her first year of college was a success  but along came Billy possessed and obsessed  He took Annie on a fatal date  and showed her things that made heart beats accelerate  Annie took a hit breathed two short breaths  one for life the last for death  Now shes gone a former valedictorian  Ended up becoming a topic for historians  Washed up dreams, shattered pride  All because Annie took a hit on the wildside   (Chorus)   Ron had enough of being broke every day  saying to himself. Theres gotta be a better way  cause 9 to 5 wasnt worth the headaches  So ron figured out a faster way to make money  Before you know it, hes a rich man  Gold on every finger of his hand  A brand new BMW. A condo. Ron ended up a john doe  A body was found in the alley but never claimed  Full of bullet holes but none to blame  Ron became another victim of homicide  because he chose to walk on the wildside   (Chorus)   Charles had everything going for him  A top paying job a good life. A good wife  A baby boy on the way any day  A gentleman attitude is all he displayed  Carol was the wife he loved and adored  Her family and friends treated him like an ambassador  One night on the other side of town  A police dispatcher picked up a weird sound  Charles on the car phone asking for help  Claiming a burglar shot his wife and himself  His pregnant wife lay slumped over  Dreams corrupt and a young life over  Extensive searches throughout the projects  put a lot of people through misery and wreck  Everyone a suspect till someone was found  Interrogated cause their skin was brown  Then there was Benny, guilty until proven so  but soon as the case started moving slow  what do you know, sure as a sea gull gets webbed toed  Charles was the culprit  The whole plot was an insurance scam  Charles and his brother came up with a plan  Kill carol collect a big check  Blame it on a black man. What the heck!  And just before the story was known  Charles had a feeling his cover was blown  so he jumped off a bridge  Committed suicide  This is how it is on the wildside!   (Chorus)   Little Tiffany. Only thirteen  Came to the city. Place of big dreams  Visiting family and friends for the summer time  Sitting on a mailbox, watching the boys climb trees  and the girls play hopscotch  So far her vacation was top notch  But of the blue a Mercedes at top speed  Gang bangers chasing the robbers on the stampede  Quick as a blink shots rang out loud  and a hail of bullets zipped through the crowd  One hit Tiffany and instantly she died  Innocently on the wildside",1992

JEWEL - FOOLISH GAMES LYRICS,"You took your coat off and stood in the rain, Youre always crazy like that. And I watched from my window, Always felt I was outside looking in on you. Youre always the mysterious one with Dark eyes and careless hair, You were fashionably sensitive But too cool to care. You stood in my doorway, with nothing to say Besides some comment on the weather.  Well in case you failed to notice, In case you failed to see, This is my heart bleeding before you, This is me down on my knees, and...  These foolish games are tearing me apart, And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart. Youre breaking my heart.  Youre always brilliant in the morning, Smoking your cigarettes and talking over coffee. Your philosophies on art, Baroque moved you. You loved Mozart and youd speak of your loved ones As I clumsily strummed my guitar.  Youd teach me of honest things, Things that were daring, things that were clean. Things that knew what an honest dollar did mean. I hid my soiled hands behind my back. Somewhere along the line, I must have gone Off track with you.  Excuse me, think Ive mistaken you for somebody else, Somebody who gave a damn, Somebody more like myself.  These foolish games are tearing me, Youre tearing me, Youre tearing me apart, And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart. Youre breaking my heart.  You took your coat off, Stood in the rain, Youre always crazy like that.",1998
