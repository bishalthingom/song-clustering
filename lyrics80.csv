HEART - THESE DREAMS LYRICS,"Spare a little candle, save some light for me Figures up ahead moving in the trees White skin in linen, perfume on my wrist And the full moon that hangs over these dreams in the mist  Darkness on the edge, shadows where I stand I search for the time on a watch with no hands I want to see you clearly, come closer than this But all I remember are the dreams in the mist  These dreams go on when I close my eyes Every second of the night I live another life These dreams that sleep when its cold outside Every moment Im awake the further Im away  Is it cloak n dagger? Could it be spring or fall? I walk without a cut through a stained glass wall Weaker in my eyesight, the candle in my grip And words that have no form are falling from my lips  These dreams go on when I close my eyes Every second of the night I live another life These dreams that sleep when its cold outside Every moment Im awake the further Im away  Theres something out there I cant resist I need to hide away from the pain Theres something out there I cant resist  The sweetest song is silence that Ive ever heard Funny how your feet in dreams never touch the earth In a wood full of princes freedom is a kiss But the prince hides his face from dreams in the mist  These dreams go on when I close my eyes Every second of the night I live another life These dreams that sleep when its cold outside Every moment Im awake the further Im away  These dreams go on when I close my eyes Every second of the night I live another life These dreams that sleep when its cold outside Every moment Im awake the further Im away",1986

MADONNA - LIVE TO TELL LYRICS,"I have a tale to tell  Sometimes it gets so hard to hide it well  I was not ready for the fall  Too blind to see the writing on the wall   A man can tell a thousand lies  Ive learned my lesson well  Hope I live to tell  The secret I have learned, till then  It will burn inside of me   I know where beauty lives  Ive seen it once, I know the warmth she gives  The light that you could never see  It shines inside, you cant take that from me   A man can tell a thousand lies  Ive learned my lesson well  Hope I live to tell  The secret I have learned, till then  It will burn inside of me   The truth is never far behind  You kept it hidden well  If I live to tell  The secret I knew then  Will I ever have the chance again?   If I ran away, Id never have the strength to go very far  How would they hear the beating of my heart  Will it grow cold, the secret that I hide? Will I grow old?  How will they hear, when will they learn, how will they know?   A man can tell a thousand lies  Ive learned my lesson well  Hope I live to tell  The secret I have learned, till then  It will burn inside of me   The truth is never far behind  You kept it hidden well  If I live to tell  The secret I knew then  Will I ever have the chance again?   A man can tell a thousand lies  Ive learned my lesson well  Hope I live to tell  The secret I have learned, till then  It will burn inside of me",1986
