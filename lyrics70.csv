DAN HILL - SOMETIMES WHEN WE TOUCH LYRICS,"You asked me if I love you, and I choke on my reply. Id rather hurt you honestly than mislead you with a lie. And who am I to judge you on what you say or do Im only just beginning to see the real you.  And sometimes when we touch The honestys too much, and I have to close my eyes and hide. I wanna hold you till I die Till we both break down and cry I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides.  Romance and all its strategy leaves me battling with my pride. But through the insecurity some tenderness survives. Im just another writer, still trapped within my truths. A hesitant prize fighter, still trapped within my youth.  And sometimes when we touch The honestys too much, and I have to close my eyes and hide. I wanna hold you till I die Till we both break down and cry I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides.  At times Id like to break you and drag you to your knees. At times Id like to break through and hold you endlessly. At times I understand you, and I know how hard youve tried. Ive watched while love commands you And Ive watched love pass you by.  At times I think were drifters, still searching for a friend. A brother or a sister, but then the passion flares again. And sometimes when we touch The honestys too much, and I have to close my eyes and hide. I wanna hold you till I die Till we both break down and cry I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides.",1978

JIM STAFFORD - WILDWOOD WEED LYRICS,"The wildwood flower grew wild on the farm, And we never knowed what it was called. Some said it was a flower and some said it was weed, I never gave it much thought ... One day I was out there talking to my brother, Reached down for a weed to chew on, Things got fuzzy and things got blurry, And then everything was gone! Didnt know what happened, But I knew it beat the hell out of sniffin burlap.  I come to and my brother was there, And he said, Whats wrong with your eyes? I said, I dont know, I was chewing on a weed. He said, Let me give it a try. We spent the rest of that day and most of that night, Trying to find my brother, Bill. Caught up with him, bout six oclock the next morning, Naked, swinging on the wind mill! He said he flew up there. I had to fly up there and bring him down, He was about half crazy ...  The very next day we picked a bunch of them weeds, And put em in the sun to dry. Then we mashed em up and chopped em up, And put em in the corncob pipe. Smokin that wildwood flower got to be a habit, We didnt see no harm. We thought it was kind of handy, Take a trip and never leave the farm!  All good things gotta come to an end, And its the same with the wildwood weed. One day this feller from Washington came by, And he spied it and turned white as a sheet. Then they dug and they burned, And they burned and they dug, And they killed all our cute little weeds. Then they drove away, We just smiled and waved ... Sittin there on that sack of seeds!  Yall come back now, hear?",1974

Cause Hells broke loose in Georgia and the Devil deals the cards. And if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold, But if you lose the devil gets your soul.  The Devil opened up his case and he said, Ill start this show. And fire flew from his fingertips as he rosined up his bow. And he pulled the bow across the strings and it made an evil hiss. And a band of demons joined in and it sounded something like this.  When the Devil finished, Johnny said, Well, youre pretty good ol son, But sit down in that chair right there and let me show you how its done.  Fire on the Mountain. Run, boys, run! The Devils in the house of the rising sun; Chickens in the bread pan picking out dough. Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, no.  The Devil bowed his head because he knew that hed been beat. And he laid that golden fiddle on the ground at Johnnys feet. Johnny said, Devil, just come on back if you ever wanna try again, Cause Ive told you once--you son of a bitch--Im the best theres ever been. And he played:  Fire on the Mountain. Run, boys, run!

DON MCLEAN - AMERICAN PIE LYRICS,"A long, long time ago, I can still remember  How that music used to make me smile  And I knew if I had my chance  That I could make those people dance  And maybe theyd be happy for a while   But February made me shiver, with every paper Id deliver  Bad news on the doorstep, I couldnt take one more step  I cant remember if I cried, when I read about his widowed bride  But something touched me deep inside the day the music died   So bye, bye Miss American Pie  Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry  And them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye  Singing thisll be the day that I die  Thisll be the day that I die   Did you write the book of love  And do you have faith in God above  If the Bible tells you so?  Now do you believe in rock and roll?  Can music save your mortal soul?  And can you teach me how to dance real slow?   Well, I know that youre in love with him  Cause I saw you dancing in the gym  You both kicked off your shoes  Man, I dig those rhythm and blues   I was a lonely teenage broncin buck  With a pink carnation and a pickup truck  But I knew I was out of luck  The day the music died   I started singing bye, bye Miss American Pie  Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry  Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye  And singing thisll be the day that I die  Thisll be the day that I die   Now, for ten years weve been on our own  And moss grows fat on a rolling stone  But thats not how it used to be  When the jester sang for the king and queen  In a coat he borrowed from James Dean  And a voice that came from you and me   Oh, and while the king was looking down  The jester stole his thorny crown  The courtroom was adjourned  No verdict was returned   And while Lenin read a book on Marx  The quartet practiced in the park  And we sang Dirges In The Dark  The day the music died   We were singing bye, bye Miss American Pie  Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry  Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye  And singing thisll be the day that I die  Thisll be the day that I die   Helter skelter in a summer swelter  The birds flew off with a fallout shelter  Eight miles high and falling fast  Landed foul on the grass  The players tried for a forward pass  With the jester on the sidelines in a cast   Now the half time air was sweet perfume  While sergeants played a marching tune  We all got up to dance  Oh, but we never got the chance   Cause the players tried to take the field  The marching band refused to yield  Do you recall what was revealed  The day the music died?   We started singing bye, bye Miss American Pie  Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry  Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye  And singing thisll be the day that I die  Thisll be the day that I die   Oh, and there we were all in one place  A generation lost in space  With no time left to start again  So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick  Jack Flash sat on a candlestick  Cause fire is the devils only friend   Oh, and as I watched him on the stage  My hands were clenched in fists of rage  No angel born in hell  Could break that Satans spell   And as the flames climbed high into the night  To light the sacrificial rite  I saw Satan laughing with delight  The day the music died   He was singing bye, bye Miss American Pie  Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry  Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye  And singing thisll be the day that I die  Thisll be the day that I die   I met a girl who sang the blues  And I asked her for some happy news  But she just smiled and turned away  I went down to the sacred store  Where Id heard the music years before  But the man there said the music wouldnt play   And in the streets the children screamed  The lovers cried and the poets dreamed  But not a word was spoken  The church bells all were broken   And the three men I admire most  The Father, Son and the Holy Ghost  They caught the last train for the coast  The day the music died   And they were singing bye, bye Miss American Pie  Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry  Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye  Singing thisll be the day that I die  Thisll be the day that I die   They were singing, bye, bye Miss American Pie  Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry  Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye  Singing thisll be the day that I die",1972
